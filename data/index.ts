  aboutMe: 'When I was a kid,  it was a friend who introduced me to the joy of programming. My friend used code they had created to move characters on a very small monitor. I still remember how excited I felt seeing the characters move just like my friend had made them. Recently, I came across the book Game Development with Rust and WebAssembly by Eric Smith. Iâ€™m thinking that programming with Rust and WebAssembly might let me experience that same excitement I felt back then.',
