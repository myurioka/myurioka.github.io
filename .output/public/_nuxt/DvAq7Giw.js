My friend used code they had created to move characters on a very small monitor. I still remember how excited I felt seeing the characters move just like my friend had made them. Recently, I came across the book Game Development with Rust and WebAssembly by Eric Smith. Iâ€™m thinking that programming with Rust and WebAssembly might let me experience that same excitement I felt back then."};export{r as a,o as b,i as c,t as f,a as h,e as n};
