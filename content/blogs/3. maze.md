## Introduction
Anyone who played Wizardry on a floppy disk as a kid has probably thought about making a maze game at some point.I used to have no clue how to create a 3D maze, but with today's powerful PCs, I've been able to bring my imaginary maze to life on screen.

## What I learned

I coded this project without overthinking things like abstraction or conditional statements. It was a pretty smooth process, but I had a lot of fun experimenting with different ways to render characters using SVG. In the end, I decided to output them as IMG tags. I thought I'd share this approach with anyone learning about WASM.
