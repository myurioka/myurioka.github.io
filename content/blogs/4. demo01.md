## Introduction
You can use WebAssembly to manipulate the browser from Rust, but when the conventions of WASM are layered with Rust's modern features such as borrowing and ownership, lifetimes, closures, and generics, even with a lot of information available, it's difficult to get your own app to build. So, I created a simple (as much as possible in one file with reduced coding) mini-app to experiment with 'web_bindgen' and 'web-sys' processing.
