## Introduction
Previously, I created a sample for a WebAssembly mini-game, but it didn't work in Edition 2024 because the use of static mut for global variables was prohibited. Therefore, to make it work in Edition 2024, I changed the way the game object was defined, moving away from using global variables and instead defining the game object using Trait + 'static."
