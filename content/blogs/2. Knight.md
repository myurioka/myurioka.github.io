## Introduction

When I was a kid, it was a friend who introduced me to the joy of programming. My friend used code they had created to move characters on a very small monitor. I still remember how excited I felt seeing the characters move just like my friend had made them. 
Recently, I just finished coding a mini-game inspired by one my friend made years ago! It brought back so many memories.
My goal is to create a world filled with the nostalgic atmosphere of retro games through making countless games, even though I'm still learning how to express myself.

## What I learned

I was thrilled to discover how cleanly I could separate the game's scenario logic from its character logic, making the code much more maintainable and easier to understand.
