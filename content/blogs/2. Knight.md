Anyone can bring their game ideas to life.

### Introduction

When I was a kid, it was a friend who introduced me to the joy of programming. My friend used code they had created to move characters on a very small monitor. I still remember how excited I felt seeing the characters move just like my friend had made them. 
Recently, I just finished coding a mini-game inspired by one my friend made years ago! It brought back so many memories.
My goal is to create a world filled with the nostalgic atmosphere of retro games through making countless games, even though I'm still learning how to express myself.

Here are the websites I referred to when coding the game loop.
