I find understandig the game loop really engoyable.

### Introduction

In the programming I usually do, a game loop is not necessary.
However, it is necessary when programing games.

I'm going to share some insights from my experience implementing a game loop with Rust and WASM.

Here are the websites I referred to when coding the game loop.

### What I enjoyed most about programing a game loop

- The code has implemented a sophisticated technique to synchronize rendering with the browser's actual frame rate.

```js
const FRAME_SIZE: f64 = 1.0 / 60.0 * 1000.0;

while game_loop.accumulated_delta > FRAME_SIZE {
    game.update(&keystate);
    game_loop.accumulated_delta -= FRAME_SIZE;
}
game_loop.last_frame = perf;
game.draw(&renderer);
```

[Browser Frame rate(FPS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/FPS)

- Rust ownership, particularly the concept of borrowing and lifetimes, is crucial for understanding this implementation.

```js
impl GameLoop {
    let f: SharedLoopClosure = Rc::new(RefCell::new(None));
    let g = f.clone();
    let mut keystate = KeyState::new();
    *g.borrow_mut() = Some(browser::create_raf_closure(move |perf: f64| {
        let _= browser::request_animation_frame(f.borrow().as_ref().unwrap());
    }));
    browser::request_animation_frame(
        g.borrow()
            .as_ref()
            .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("GameLoop: Loop is None"))?,
    )?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### It was a fun experience to code a game

Forty years ago, my first personal computer was an MSX2. I enjoyed programming by typing in the source code published in BASIC Magazine. The first program I typed was a racing game similar to the one I've created recently. Though my memory is a bit hazy, I recall the walls being represented by "#" and the car by a diamond character "â™¢". I remember spending hours correcting typos while referencing the magazine's source code. The joy I felt when the copied program finally ran is something I'll never forget. The excitement of seeing a program come to life hasn't changed at all, even now.
