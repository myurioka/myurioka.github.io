## Introduction
I've created a mini-game using the Gemini API. I implemented it by adding asynchronous processing for WebAssembly to the Template I created last time. The asynchronous processing required for HTTP access to external resources, as before, is using the browser's API instead of being implemented within Wasm. Next time, I'd like to incorporate asynchronous processing directly within Wasm...
